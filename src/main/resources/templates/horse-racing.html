  <h1>Horse Racing Exercise</h1>
  <p>
    We are going to play a special version of the horse racing derby game (better known as Kentucky Derby)
    you can find in several fun fairs (see picture below).

  <h2>Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The track length is 1 furlong.
    </li>
    <li>
      There will be a maximum of 7 horses playing. Consequently, the track has 7 lanes in it (numbered from 1 to 7).
    </li>
    <li>
      Each horse has a name and it will be in one lane.
    </li>
    <li>
      To move a horse each virtual player tosses a ball to a set of holes, each hole has a number. This is the number
      of yards the horse will advance.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are 11 holes for each lane. The numbers in the holes are the following: 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 40, 60
    </li>
    <li>
      The winner will be the first horse to reach the goal (i.e. the first horse to go acrross 1 furlong)
    </li>
    <li>
      The race ends when the first horse reaches the goal. The positions of the other horses will stand frozen even
      if more balls are thrown.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The first line of the input will contain the names of the horses ordered according to the lane they will be running in:
      <code>HORSE1, HORSE2, ....</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      The rest of the lines of the input will represent a ball throw. The format will be: <code>LANE_NUMBER YARDS</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>
    The output will be the list of horses ordered by distance in the race:
    <pre>
      Position, Lane, Horse name
      1, 2, HORSE2
      2, 5, HORSE5
    </pre>
  </p>

    1 60
    3 20
